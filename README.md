# GCS-Timer

GCS-Timer is a GPU-accelerated static timing analyzer based on the advanced Composite Current Source (CCS) timing model. 

Check out the following paper for more details.

## Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cuhk-eda/GCS-Timer.git
mkdir GCS-Timer/lib
```
Download the following to the `GCS-Timer/lib` directory from the `LIB/CCS` folder of [ASAP7](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/asap7sc7p5t_28).

## Compile
```bash
nvcc src/main.cpp -x cu -arch=sm_86 -o GCS_Timer -std=c++14 -O3
```
You may want to change `-arch=sm_86` according to your GPU.

## Run
```bash
./GCS_Timer <benchmark_name> [-CPU]
```
`benchmark_name` can be `mul`, `log2`, `div` and `hyp`, which are the designs used for evaluation in the paper.

`-CPU` enables the CPU version.

Examples:

Running `mul` on GPU

```bash
./GCS_Timer mul
```

Running `mul` on CPU

```bash
./GCS_Timer mul -CPU
```

The spef files of `div` and `hyp` are zipped and need to be unzipped first.

## Benchmarks and Evaluation

The benchmarks are the four largest arithmetic designs from the [EPFL combinational benchmark suite](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsi/page-102566-en-html/benchmarks/). They are synthesized, placed and routed using commercial tools. Each design consists of a verilog file (`test.v`) and a spef file (`test.spef`) for timing analysis. Delay results of each cell and net are provided in `pt_cell.results/pt_net.results` (by PrimeTime) and `spice_deck_all.txt` (by HSPICE). `test.pt` contains the graph-based analysis results by PrimeTime.

### Stage Delay Calculation
To evaluate the net/cell delay accuracy of GCS-Timer, variable `EVALUATE` in file `gpu_timer.hpp` must be set to `1`. This sets the input slew of each driver gate to the same value as that is used to generate the PrimeTime and HSPICE delay results (this value is extracted from PrimeTime) to ensure fair comparison. When `EVALUATE` is set to `1`, GCS-Timer reads `pt_cell.results/pt_net.results/spice_deck_all.txt` and output the comparison results.

HSPICE is a transistor-level simulation tool that is inherently more accurate than gate-level delay calculators such as PrimeTime and GCS-Timer. Using HSPICE as a reference tool, we show that GCS-Timer is more accurate than PrimeTime in terms of net/cell delay calculation.

### Graph-Based Analysis (GBA)
By default (`EVALUATE=0`), GCS-Timer generates the arrival time of each output port, which can be compared with PrimeTime's timing results in `test.pt`. This comparison is for reference only, as there are no "golden" results (GBA is beyond the capabilities of HSPICE). Nevertheless, we believe that GCS-Timer is more accurate than PrimeTime, because GBA essentially accumulates cell/net delays in a graph and the individual cell/net delays calculated by GCS-Timer are more accurate.
